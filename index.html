        <p>Do No Harm License</p>
        <p><strong>Preamble</strong></p>
        <p>Most software today is developed with little to no thought of how it will be used, or the consequences for our society and planet.</p>
        <p>As software developers, we engineer the infrastructure of the 21st century. We recognise that our infrastructure has great power to shape the world and the lives of those we share it with, and we choose to consciously take responsibility for the social and environmental impacts of what we build.</p>
        <p>We envisage a world free from injustice, inequality, and the reckless destruction of lives and our planet. We reject slavery in all its forms, whether by force, indebtedness, or by algorithms that hack human vulnerabilities. We seek a world where humankind is at peace with our neighbours, nature, and ourselves. We want our work to enrich the physical, mental and spiritual wellbeing of all society.</p>
        <p>We build software to further this vision of a just world, or at the very least, to not put that vision further from reach.</p>

<pre>                         Aladdin Free Public Licence
                         (Version 7, June 4, 1998)

          Copyright (C) 1994, 1995, 1997, 1998 Aladdin Enterprises,
            Menlo Park, California, U.S.A. All rights reserved.

     NOTE: This Licence is not the same as any of the GNU Licences
     published by the Free Software Foundation. Its terms are
     substantially different from those of the GNU Licences. If you are
     familiar with the GNU Licences, please read this licence with
     extra care.

Aladdin Enterprises hereby grants to anyone the permission to apply this
Licence to their own work, as long as the entire Licence (including the
above notices and this paragraph) is copied with no changes, additions, or
deletions except for changing the first paragraph of Section 0 to include a
suitable description of the work to which the licence is being applied and
of the person or entity that holds the copyright in the work, and, if the
Licence is being applied to a work created in a country other than the
United States, replacing the first paragraph of Section 6 with an
appropriate reference to the laws of the appropriate country.

0. Subject Matter

This Licence applies to the computer program known as "GSview."  
The "Program", below, refers to such program.  The Program is a copyrighted
work whose copyright is held by Ghostgum Software Pty Ltd (the "Licensor").

A "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative
work of the Program, as defined in the United States Copyright Act of 1976,
such as a translation or a modification.

BY MODIFYING OR DISTRIBUTING THE PROGRAM (OR ANY WORK BASED ON THE PROGRAM),
YOU INDICATE YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THIS LICENSE TO DO SO, AND ALL ITS TERMS AND
CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTING OR MODIFYING THE PROGRAM OR WORKS BASED
ON IT. NOTHING OTHER THAN THIS LICENSE GRANTS YOU PERMISSION TO MODIFY OR
DISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM OR ITS DERIVATIVE WORKS. THESE ACTIONS ARE PROHIBITED
BY LAW. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, DO NOT MODIFY OR
DISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM.

1. Licences.

Licensor hereby grants you the following rights, provided that you comply
with all of the restrictions set forth in this Licence and provided,
further, that you distribute an unmodified copy of this Licence with the
Program:

(a)  You may copy and distribute literal (i.e., verbatim) copies of the
     Program's source code as you receive it throughout the world, in any
     medium.
(b)  You may modify the Program, create works based on the Program and
     distribute copies of such throughout the world, in any medium.

2. Restrictions.

This licence is subject to the following restrictions:

(a)  Distribution of the Program or any work based on the Program by a
     commercial organization to any third party is prohibited if any payment
     is made in connection with such distribution, whether directly (as in
     payment for a copy of the Program) or indirectly (as in payment for
     some service related to the Program, or payment for some product or
     service that includes a copy of the Program "without charge"; these are
     only examples, and not an exhaustive enumeration of prohibited
     activities). The following methods of distribution involving payment
     shall not in and of themselves be a violation of this restriction:
     (i)  Posting the Program on a public access information storage and
          retrieval service for which a fee is received for retrieving
          information (such as an on-line service), provided that the fee is
          not content-dependent (i.e., the fee would be the same for
          retrieving the same volume of information consisting of random
          data) and that access to the service and to the Program is
          available independent of any other product or service. An example
          of a service that does not fall under this section is an on-line
          service that is operated by a company and that is only available
          to customers of that company. (This is not an exhaustive
          enumeration.)
     (ii) Distributing the Program on removable computer-readable media,
          provided that the files containing the Program are reproduced
          entirely and verbatim on such media, that all information on such
          media be redistributable for non-commercial purposes without
          charge, and that such media are distributed by themselves (except
          for accompanying documentation) independent of any other product
          or service. Examples of such media include CD-ROM, magnetic tape,
          and optical storage media. (This is not intended to be an
          exhaustive list.) An example of a distribution that does not fall
          under this section is a CD-ROM included in a book or magazine.
          (This is not an exhaustive enumeration.)
(b)  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification of the
     Program are not subject to this Licence and they are outside its scope.
     Functional use (running) of the Program is not restricted, and any
     output produced through the use of the Program is subject to this
     licence only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
     (independent of having been made by running the Program).
(c)  You must meet all of the following conditions with respect to any work
     that you distribute or publish that in whole or in part contains or is
     derived from the Program or any part thereof ("the Work"):
     (i)  If you have modified the Program, you must cause the Work to carry
          prominent notices stating that you have modified the Program's
          files and the date of any change;
     (ii) You must cause the Work to be licensed as a whole and at no charge
          to all third parties under the terms of this Licence;
     (iii)
          If the Work normally reads commands interactively when run, you
          must cause it, at each time the Work commences operation, to print
          or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright
          notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying
          that you provide a warranty). Such notice must also state that
          users may redistribute the Work only under the conditions of this
          Licence and tell the user how to view the copy of this Licence
          included with the Work. (Exceptions: if the Program is interactive
          but normally prints or displays such an announcement only at the
          request of a user, such as in an "About box", the Work is required
          to print or display the notice only under the same circumstances;
          if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print
          such an announcement, the Work is not required to print an
          announcement.);
     (iv) You must accompany the Work with the complete corresponding
          machine-readable source code, delivered on a medium customarily
          used for software interchange. The source code for a work means
          the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For
          an executable work, complete source code means all the source code
          for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
          definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and
          installation of the executable code. If you distribute with the
          Work any component that is normally distributed (in either source
          or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and
          so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, you
          must also distribute the source code of that component if you have
          it and are allowed to do so;
     (v)  If you distribute any written or printed material at all with the
          Work, such material must include either a written copy of this
          Licence, or a prominent written indication that the Work is
          covered by this Licence and written instructions for printing
          and/or displaying the copy of the Licence on the distribution
          medium;
     (vi) You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipient's
          exercise of the rights granted herein.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering the
equivalent ability to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
ability to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution
of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the
source code along with the object code.

3. Reservation of Rights.

No rights are granted to the Program except as expressly set forth herein.
You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as
expressly provided under this Licence. Any attempt otherwise to copy,
modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically
terminate your rights under this Licence. However, parties who have received
copies, or rights, from you under this Licence will not have their licences
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

4. Other Restrictions.

If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain
countries for any reason, Licensor may add an explicit geographical
distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is
permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this
Licence incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this
Licence.

5. Limitations.

THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED TO YOU "AS IS," WITHOUT WARRANTY. THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS. THE ENTIRE
RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD
THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL
LICENSOR, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM
AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL,
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR
DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES
OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

6. General.

This Licence is governed by the laws of the State of Victoria, 
Australia, excluding choice of law rules.

If any part of this Licence is found to be in conflict with the law, that
part shall be interpreted in its broadest meaning consistent with the law,
and no other parts of the Licence shall be affected.</pre>
