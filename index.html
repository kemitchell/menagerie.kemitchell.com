      <blockquote>
        <b>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION, USE AND/OR MODIFICATION</b>
        <p>
        0. 	DEFINITIONS.  The following are defined terms that, whenever used in this License Agreement, have the following meanings:
        <p>
          0.1	Author: "Author" shall mean the copyright holder of an Original Work (the "Program") released by the Author under this License Agreement. 
        <p>
          0.2	Copy: "Copy" shall mean everything and anything that constitutes a copy according to copyright law, without limitation.  A "copy" does not become anything other than a "copy" merely because, for example, a governmental or institutional employee duplicates the Program or a part of it for another employee of the same institution or Governmental Entity, or merely because it is copied from one computer to another, or from one medium to another, or multiple copies are made on the same medium, within the same institutional or Governmental Entity.
        <p>
          0.3	Derivative Work: A "Derivative Work" or "work based on the Program" shall mean either the Program itself or any work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification.").  In the unlikely event that, and to the extent that, this contractual definition of "Derivative Work" is later determined by any tribunal or dispute-resolution body to be different is scope from the meaning of "derivative work" under the copyright law of any country, then the broadest and most encompassing possible definition   either the contractual definition of "Derivative Work," or any broader and more encompassing statutory or legal definition, shall control.  Acceptance of this contractually-defined scope of the term "Derivative Work" is a mandatory pre-condition for You to receive any of the benefits offered by this License Agreement. 
        <p>
            0.3.1	Mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a Derivative Work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License Agreement.
        <p>
          0.4	License Agreement: When used in this License Agreement, the terms "this License" or "this License Agreement" shall mean The Hactivismo Enhanced-Source Software License Agreement, v. 0.1, or any subsequent version made applicable under the terms of Section 15.
        <p>
          0.5	Licensee: The term "Licensee" shall mean You or any other Licensee, whether or not a Qualified Licensee.
        <p>
          0.6	Original Work: "Original Work" shall mean a Program or other work of authorship, or portion thereof, that is not a Derivative Work.
        <p>
          0.7	Program: The "Program," to which this License Agreement applies, is the Original Work (including, but not limited to, computer software) released by the Author under this License Agreement.
        <p>
          0.8	Qualified Licensee: A "Qualified Licensee" means a Licensee that remains in full compliance with all terms and conditions of this License Agreement.  You are no longer a Qualified Licensee if, at any time, You violate any terms of this License Agreement.  Neither the Program nor any Software based on the Program may be copied, distributed, performed, displayed, used or modified by You, even for Your own purposes, unless You are a Qualified Licensee.   A Licensee other than a Qualified Licensee remains subject to all terms and conditions of this License Agreement, and to all remedies for each cumulative violation as set forth herein.  Loss of the status of Qualified Licensee signifies that violation of any terms of the License Agreement subjects a Licensee to loss of most of the benefits that Qualified Licensees enjoy under this License Agreement, and to additional remedies for all violations occurring after the first violation.
        <p>
            0.9	Software: "Software" or "the Software" shall mean the Program, any Derivative Work based on the Program or a portion thereof, and/or any modified version of the Program or portion thereof, without limitation.
        <p>
          0.10	Source Code:  The term "Source Code" shall mean the preferred form of a Program or Original Work for making modifications to it and all available documentation describing how to access and modify that Program or Original Work. 
        <p>
            0.10.1	For an executable work, complete Source Code means all the Source Code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a special exception, the Source Code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable. 
        <p>
            0.10.2	"Object Code:"  Because of certain peculiarities of current export-control rules, "object code" of the Program, or any modified version of the Program, or Derivative Work based on the Program, must not be exported except by way of distribution that is ancillary to the distribution of the Source Code.  The "Source Code" shall be understood as the primary content transferred or exported by You, and the "object code" shall be considered as merely an ancillary component of any such export distribution.
        <p>
          0.11	Strong Cryptography:  "Strong Cryptography" shall mean cryptography no less secure than (for example, and without limitation) a 2048-bit minimum key size for RSA encryption, 1024-bit minimum key size for Diffie-Hellman (El Gamal), or a 256-bit minimum key size for AES and similar symmetric ciphers.
        <p>
          0.12	Substandard Key-Selection Technique: The term "Substandard Key-Selection Technique" shall mean a method or technique to cause encryption keys to be more easily guessed or less secure, such as by (i) causing the selection of keys to be less than random, or (ii) employing a selection process that selects among only a subset of possible keys, instead of from among the largest set of possible keys that can securely be used consistent with contemporary knowledge about the cryptographic techniques employed by You.  The following illustrations elaborate on the foregoing definition: 
        <p>
            0.12.1	If the key-generation or key-selection technique for the encryption algorithm You employ involves the selection of one or more prime numbers, or involves one or more mathematical functions or concatenations performed on one or more prime numbers, then each prime number should be selected from a very large set of candidate prime numbers, but not necessarily from the set of all possible prime numbers (e.g., inclusion of the number 1 in the candidate set, for example, may in some instances reduce rather than enhance security), and absolutely not from any artificially small set of candidate primes that makes the guessing of a key easier than would be the case if a secure key-generation technique were employed.  In all instances, the primes should be selected at random from among the candidate set.  If there is a customary industry standard for maximizing the security associated with the key-generation or key-selection technique for the cryptosystem You select, then (with attention also to the requirements of Section 0.11), You should employ a key-generation or selection technique no less secure than the customary industry standard for secure use of the cryptosystem.
        <p>
            0.12.2	If the key-generation or key-selection technique for the encryption algorithm You employ involves the selection of a random integer, or the transformation of a random integer through one or more mathematical processes, then the selection of the integer shall be at random from the largest possible set of all possible integers consistent with the secure functioning of the encryption algorithm.  It shall not be selected from an artificially small set of integers (e.g., if a 256-bit random integer serves as the key, then You could not set 200 of the 256 bits as "0," and randomly generate only the remaining 56 bits   producing effectively a 56-bit keylength instead of using the full 256 bits). 
        <p>
            0.12.3	In other words, Your key-generation technique must promote security to the maximum extent permitted by the cryptographic method(s) and keylength You elect to employ, rather than facilitating eavesdropping or surveillance in any way.  The example of GSM telephones, in which 16 of 56 bits in each encryption key were set at "0," thereby reducing the security of the system by a factor of 65,536, is particularly salient.  Such artificial techniques to reduce the security of a cryptosystem by selecting keys from only a less-secure or suboptimal subset of possible keys, is prohibited and will violate this License Agreement if any such technique is employed in any Software.
        <p>
          0.13	You:	Each Licensee (including, without limitation, Licensees that have violated the License Agreement and who are no longer Qualified Licensees, but who nevertheless remain subject to all requirements of this License Agreement and to all cumulative remedies for each successive violation), is referred to as "You."
        <p>
            0.13.1	Governmental Entity: "You" explicitly includes any and all "Governmental Entities," without limitation.  "Governmental Entity" or "Governmental Entities," when used in this License Agreement, shall mean national governments, sub-national governments (for example, and without limitation, provincial, state, regional, local and municipal governments, autonomous governing units, special districts, and other such entities), governmental subunits (without limitation, governmental agencies, offices, departments, government corporations, and the like), supra-national governmental entities such as the European Union, and entities through which one or more governments perform governmental functions or exercise governmental power in coordination, cooperation or unison. 
        <p>
            0.13.2	Governmental Person: "You" also explicitly includes "Governmental Persons."  The terms "Governmental Person" or "Governmental Persons," when used in this License Agreement, shall mean the officials, officers, employees, representatives, contractors and agents of any Governmental Entity. 
        <p>
        1.	Application of License Agreement.  This License Agreement applies to any Program or other Original Work of authorship that contains a notice placed by the Author saying it may be distributed under the terms of this License Agreement.  The preferred manner of placing such a notice is to include the following statement immediately after the copyright notice for such an Original Work:
        <blockquote>
            <p>"Licensed under the Hacktivismo Enhanced-Source Software License Agreement, Version 0.1"
        </blockquote>
        <p>
        2.	Means of Acceptance   Use, Copying, Distribution or Modification By Anyone Constitutes Acceptance.  Subject to Section 14.1 (concerning the special case of certain Governmental Entities) any copying, modification, distribution, or use by You of the Program or any Software, shall constitute Your acceptance of all terms and conditions  of this License Agreement.
        <p>
          2.1	As a Licensee, You may not authorize, permit, or enable any person to use the Program or any Software or Derivative Work based on it (including any use of Your copy or copies of the Program) unless such person has accepted this License Agreement and has become a Licensee subject to all its terms and conditions.
        <p>
          2.2	You may not make any copy for Your own use unless You have accepted this License Agreement and subjected yourself to all its terms and conditions.
        <p>
          2.3	You may not make a copy for the use of any other person, or transfer a copy to any other person, unless such person is a Licensee that has accepted this License Agreement and such person is subject to all terms and conditions of this License Agreement.
        <p>
          2.4	It is not the position of Hacktivismo that copyright law confers an exclusive right to use, as opposed to the exclusive right to copy the Software.  However, for purposes of contract law, any use of the Software shall be considered to constitute acceptance of this License Agreement.  Moreover, all copying is prohibited unless the recipient of a copy has accepted the License Agreement.  Because each such recipient Licensee is contractually obligated not to permit anyone to access, use, or secure a copy of the Software, without first accepting the terms and conditions of this License Agreement, use by non-Licensees is effectively prohibited contractually because nobody can obtain a copy of, or access to a copy of, any Software without (1) accepting the License Agreement through use, and (2) triggering some Licensee's obligation to require acceptance as a precondition of copying or access.
        <p>
        3.	"Qualified Licensee" Requirement:  Neither the Program nor any Software or Derivative Work based on the Program may be copied, distributed, displayed, performed, used or modified by You, even for Your own purposes, unless You are a "Qualified Licensee."  To remain a Qualified Licensee, You must remain in full compliance with all terms and conditions of this License Agreement.
        <p>
        4.	License Agreement Is Exclusive Source of All Your Rights:
        <p>
          4.1	You may not copy, modify, or distribute the Program, or obtain any copy, except as expressly provided under this License Agreement.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, obtain a copy, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate Your rights under this License Agreement and subject You to all cumulative remedies for each successive violation that may be available to the Author.   However, Qualified Licensees who have received copies from You (and thereby have received rights from the Author) under this License Agreement, and who would otherwise qualify as Qualified Licensees, will not have their rights under their License Agreements suspended or restricted on account of anything You do, so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
        <p>
          4.2 	You are not required to accept this License Agreement and prior to the time You elect to become a Licensee and accept this License Agreement, You may always elect instead not to copy, use, modify, distribute, compile, or perform the Program or any Software released under this License Agreement.  However, nothing else grants You permission to copy, to obtain or possess a copy, to compile a copy in object code or executable code from a copy in source code, to modify, or to distribute the Program or any Software based on the Program.  These actions are prohibited by law if You do not accept this License Agreement.  Additionally, as set forth in Section 2, any use, copying or modification of the Software constitutes acceptance of this License Agreement by You.
        <p>
          4.3 	Each time You redistribute the Program (or any Software or Derivative Work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a License Agreement from the Author to copy, distribute, modify, perform or display the Software, subject to the terms and conditions of this License Agreement.  You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License Agreement.  Enforcement is the responsibility of the Author.
        <p>
        5.	Grant of Source Code License.   
        <p>
          5.1	Source Code Always Available from Author:  Author hereby promises and agrees   except to the extent prohibited by export-control law   to provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Program at the request of any Licensee.  Author reserves the right to satisfy this obligation by placing a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the most current version of the Program in an information repository reasonably calculated to permit inexpensive and convenient access by You for so long as Author continues to distribute the Program, and by publishing the address of that information repository in a notice immediately following the copyright notice that applies to the Program. Every copy of the Program distributed by Hacktivismo (but not necessarily every other Author) consists of the Source Code accompanied, in some instances, by an ancillary distribution of compiled Object Code, but the continued availability of the Source Code from the Author addresses the possibility that You might have (for any reason) not received from someone else a complete, current, copy of the Source Code (lack of which would, for example, prevent You from exporting copies to others without violating this license, see Section 8).
        <p>
          5.2	Grant of License.  If and only if, and for so long as You remain a Qualified Licensee, in accordance with Section 3 of this License Agreement, Author hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable copyright license to do the following: 
        <p>
            5.2.1 	to reproduce the Source Code of the Program in copies; 
        <p>
            5.2.2	to prepare Derivative Works based upon the Program and to edit or modify the Source Code in the process of preparing such Derivative Works; 
        <p>
            5.2.3	to distribute copies of the Source Code of the Original Work and/or of Derivative Works to others, with the proviso that copies of Original Work or Derivative Works that You distribute shall be licensed under this License Agreement, and that You shall fully inform all recipients of the terms of this License Agreement.
        <p>
        6.	Grant of Copyright License.  If and only if, and for so long as You remain a Qualified Licensee, in accordance with Section 3 of this License Agreement, Author hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable license to do the following:
        <p>
          6.1 	to reproduce the Program in copies; 
        <p>
          6.2	to prepare Derivative Works based upon the Program, or upon Software that itself is based on the Program; 
        <p>
          6.3	to distribute (either by distributing the Source Code, or by distributing compiled Object Code, but any export of Object Code must be  ancillary to a distribution of Source Code) copies of the Program and Derivative Works to others, with the proviso that copies of the Program or Derivative Works that You distribute shall be licensed under this License Agreement, that You shall fully inform all recipients of the terms of this License Agreement; 
        <p>
          6.4 	to perform the Program or a Derivative Work publicly; 
        <p>
          6.5	to display the Program or a Derivative Work publicly; and
        <p>
          6.6	to charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy of the Program (You may also, at Your option, offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee). 
        <p>
        7.	Grant of Patent License.  If and only if, and for so long as You remain a Qualified Licensee, in accordance with Section 3 of this License Agreement, Author hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable license Agreement, under patent claims owned or controlled by the Author that are embodied in the Program as furnished by the Author ("Licensed Claims") to make, use, sell and offer for sale the Program.  Subject to the proviso that You grant all Licensees a world-wide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license under any patent claims embodied in any Derivative Work furnished by You, Author hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable license under the Licensed Claims to make, use, sell and offer for sale Derivative Works.
        <p>
        8. 	Exclusions From License Agreement Grants.  Nothing in this License Agreement shall be deemed to grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property of Licensor except as expressly stated herein. No patent license is granted to make, use, sell or offer to sell embodiments of any patent claims other than the Licensed Claims defined in Section 7.  No right is granted to the trademarks of Author even if such marks are included in the Program.  Nothing in this License Agreement shall be interpreted to prohibit Author from licensing under additional or different terms from this License Agreement any Original Work, Program, or Derivative Work that Author otherwise would have a right to License. 
        <p>
          8.1	Implied Endorsements Prohibited.  Neither the name of the Author (in the case of Programs and Original Works released by Hacktivismo, the name "Hacktivismo"), nor the names of contributors who helped produce the Program may be used to endorse or promote modifications of the Program, any Derivative Work, or any Software other than the Program, without specific prior written permission of the Author.  Neither the name of Hacktivismo nor the names of any contributors who helped write the Program may be used to endorse or promote any Program or Software released under this License Agreement by any person other than Hacktivismo. 
        <p>
        9.	Modifications and Derivative Works.  Only Qualified Licensees may modify the Software or prepare or distribute Derivative Works.  If You are a Qualified Licensee, Your authorization to modify the Software or prepare or distribute Derivative Works  (including permission to prepare and/or distribute Derivative Works, as provided in Sections 5.2.2, 5.2.3, 6.2, 6.3, and 6.6) is subject to each and all of the following mandatory terms and conditions (9.1 through 9.6, inclusive): 
        <p>
          9.1	You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files and the date of any change;
        <p>
          9.2	If the modified Software normally reads commands interactively when run, You must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that You provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under this License Agreement, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License Agreement. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, Your Derivative Work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.); 
        <p>
          9.3	Any Program, Software, or modification thereof copied or distributed by You, that incorporates any portion of the Original Work, must not contain any code or functionality that subverts the security of the Software or the end-user's expectations of privacy, anonymity, confidentiality, authenticity, and trust, including (without limitation) any code or functionality that introduces any "backdoor," escrow mechanism, "spy-ware," or surveillance techniques or methods into any such Program, Software, or modification thereof;
        <p>
          9.4	Any Program, Software, or modification thereof copied or distributed by You, that employs any cryptographic or other security, privacy, confidentiality, authenticity, and/or trust methods or techniques, including without limitation any Derivative Work that includes any changes or modifications to any cryptographic techniques in the Program, shall employ Strong Cryptography.
        <p>
          9.5	Any Program, Software, or modification thereof copied or distributed by You, if it contains any key-generation or selection technique, must not employ any Substandard Key-Selection Technique. 
        <p>
        9.6 	No Program or Software copied or distributed by You may transmit or communicate any symmetric key, any "private key" if an asymmetric cryptosystem is employed, or any part of such key, nor may it otherwise make any such key or part of such key known, to any person other than the end-user who generated the key, without the active consent and participation of that individual end-user.  If a private or symmetric key is stored or recorded in any manner, it must not be stored or recorded in plaintext, and it must be protected from reading (at a minimum) by use of a password.  Use of steganography or other techniques to disguise the fact that a private or symmetric key is even stored is strongly encouraged, but not absolutely required.
        <p>
        10.	Use Restrictions: Human Rights Violations Prohibited. 
        <p>
          10.1	Neither the Program, nor any Software or Derivative Work based on the Program may used by You for any of the following purposes (10.1.1 through 10.1.5, inclusive):
        <p>
            10.1.1	to violate or infringe any human rights or to deprive any person of human rights, including, without limitation, rights of privacy, security, collective action, expression, political freedom, due process of law, and individual conscience;
        <p>
          10.1.2	to gather evidence against any person to be used to deprive any person of human rights;
        <p>
          10.1.3	any other use as a part of any project or activity to deprive any person of human rights, including not only the above-listed rights, but also rights of physical security, liberty from physical restraint or incarceration, freedom from slavery, freedom from torture, freedom to take part in government, either directly or through lawfully elected representatives, and/or freedom from self-incrimination;
         <p>
          10.1.4	any surveillance, espionage, or monitoring of individuals, whether done by a Governmental Entity, a Governmental Person, or by any non-governmental person or entity;
        <p>
          10.1.5	censorship or "filtering" of any published information or expression.  
        <p>
        10.2	Additionally, the Program, any modification of it, or any Software or Derivative Work based on the Program may not be used by any Governmental Entity or other institution that has any policy or practice (whether official or unofficial) of violating the human rights of any persons.
        <p>
        10.3	You may not authorize, permit, or enable any person (including, without limitation, any Governmental Entity or Governmental Person)  to use the Program or any Software or Derivative Work based on it (including any use of Your copy or copies of the Program) unless such person has accepted this License Agreement and has become a Licensee subject to all its terms and conditions, including (without limitation) the use restrictions embodied in Section 10.1 and 10.2, inclusive.
        <p>
        11.	All Export Distributions Must Consist of or Be Ancillary to Distribution of Source Code.  Because of certain peculiarities of current export-control law, any distribution by You of the Program or any Software may be in the form of Source Code only, or in the form or Source Code accompanied by compiled Object Code, but You may not export any Software in the form of compiled Object Code only.  Such an export distribution of compiled executable code must in all cases be ancillary to a distribution of the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed on a medium, or by a method, customarily used for software interchange.
        </p>
        <p>
        12.	EXPORT LAWS: THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT ADDS NO RESTRICTIONS TO THE EXPORT LAWS OF YOUR JURISDICTION.  It is Your responsibility to comply with any export regulations applicable in Your jurisdiction.  From the United States, Canada, or many countries in Europe, export or transmission of this Software to certain embargoed destinations (including, but not necessarily limited to, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria), may be prohibited.  If Hacktivismo is identified as the Author of the Program (and it is not the property of some other Author), then export to any national of Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan or Syria, or into the territory of any of these countries, by any Licensee who has received this Software directly from Hacktivismo or from the Cult of the Dead Cow, or any of their members, is contractually prohibited and will constitute a violation of this License Agreement.  You are advised to consult the current laws of any and all countries whose laws may apply to You, before exporting this Software to any destination.  Special care should be taken to avoid export to any embargoed destination.  An Author other than Hacktivismo may substitute that Author's legal name for "Hacktivismo" in this Paragraph, in relation to any Program released by that Author under this Paragraph.
        <p>
        13.	Contrary Judgments, Settlements and Court Orders.  If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on You (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License Agreement, they do not excuse You from the conditions of this License Agreement.  If You cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously Your obligations under this License Agreement and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence You may not distribute the Software at all.  For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through You, then the only way You could satisfy both it and this License Agreement would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program. 
        <p>
        It is not the purpose of this Section 13 to induce You to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this Section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the software distribution system reflected in this License Agreement, which is implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through related distribution systems, in reliance on consistent application of such distribution systems; it is up to the Author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a Licensee cannot impose that choice. 
        <p>
        14. 	Governmental Entities: Any Governmental Entity ("Governmental Entity" is defined broadly as set forth in Section 0.13.1) or Governmental Person (as "Governmental Person" is defined broadly in Section 0.13.2), that uses, modifies, changes, copies, displays, performs, or distributes the Program, or any Software or Derivative Work based on the Program, may do so if and only if all of the following terms and conditions (14.1 through 14.10, inclusive) are agreed to and fully met:
        <p>
        14.1 	If it is the position of any Governmental Entity (or, in the case of any "Governmental Person," if it is the position of that Governmental Person's Governmental Entity) that any doctrine or doctrines of law (including, without limitation, any doctrine(s) of immunity or any formalities of contract formation) may render this License Agreement unenforceable or less than fully enforceable against such Governmental Entity, or any Governmental Person of such Governmental Entity, then prior to any use, modification, change, display, performance, copy or distribution of the Program, or of any Software or Derivative Work based on the Program, or any part thereof, by the Governmental Entity, or by any Governmental Person of that Governmental Entity, the Governmental Entity shall be required to inform the Author in writing of each such doctrine that is believed to render this License Agreement or any part of it less than fully enforceable against such Governmental Entity or any Governmental Person of such entity, and to explain in reasonable detail what additional steps, if taken, would render the License Agreement fully enforceable against such entity or person.  Failure to provide the required written notice to the Author in advance of any such use, modification, change, display, performance, copy or distribution, shall constitute an irrevocable and conclusive waiver of any and all reliance on any doctrine, by the Governmental Entity, that is not included or that is omitted from the required written notice (failure to provide any written notice means all reliance on any doctrine is irrevocably waived).  Any Governmental Entity that provides written notice under this subsection is prohibited, as are all of the Governmental Persons of such Governmental Entity, from making any use, change, display, performance, copy, modification or distribution of the Software or any part thereof, until such time as a License Agreement is in place, agreed upon by the Author and by the Governmental Entity, that such entity concedes is fully-enforceable.  Any use, modification, change, display, performance, copy, or distribution following written notice under this Paragraph, but without the implementation of an agreement as provided herein, shall constitute an irrevocable and conclusive waiver by the Governmental Entity (and any and all Governmental Persons of such Governmental Entity) of any and all reliance on any legal doctrine either referenced in such written notice or omitted from it.
        <p>
        14.2	Any Governmental Entity that uses, copies, changes, modifies, or distributes, the Software or any part or portion thereof, or any Governmental Person who does so (whether that person's Governmental Entity contends the person's action was, or was not, authorized or official), permanently and irrevocably waives any defense based on sovereign immunity, official immunity, the Act of State Doctrine, or any other form of immunity, that might otherwise apply as a defense to, or a bar against, any legal action based on the terms of this License Agreement.
        <p>
          14.2.1	With respect to any enforcement action brought by the Author in a United States court against a foreign Governmental Entity, the waiver by any Governmental Entity   as provided in Subparagraphs 14.1 and 14.2   is hereby expressly acknowledged by each such Governmental Entity to constitute a "case . . . in which the foreign state has waived its immunity," within the scope of 28 U.S.C.  1605(a)(1) of the Foreign  Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (as amended).  Each such Governmental Entity also specifically agrees and concedes that the "commercial activity" exceptions to the FSIA, 28 U.S.C.  1605(a)(2), (3) are also applicable.  With respect to an action brought against the United States or any United States Governmental Entity, in the courts of any country, the U.S. Governmental Entity shall be understood to have voluntarily agreed to a corresponding waiver of immunity from actions in the courts of any other sovereign. 
        <p>
          14.2.2	With respect to any enforcement action brought by an authorized end-user (as a third-party beneficiary, under the terms of Subparagraphs 14.3 and 14.10) in a United States court against a foreign Governmental Entity, the waiver by any Governmental Entity   as provided in Subparagraphs 14.1 and 14.2   is hereby expressly acknowledged by each such Governmental Entity to constitute a "case . . . in which the foreign state has waived its immunity," within the scope of 28 U.S.C.  1605(a)(1) of the Foreign  Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (as amended).  .  Each such Governmental Entity also specifically agrees and concedes that the "commercial activity" exceptions to the FSIA, 28 U.S.C.  1605(a)(2), (3) are also applicable.  With respect to an action brought against the United States or any United States Governmental Entity, in the courts of any country, the U.S. Governmental Entity shall be understood to have voluntarily agreed to a corresponding waiver of immunity from actions in the courts of any other sovereign.
        <p>
          14.2.3	With respect to any action or effort by the Author in the United States to execute a judgment against a foreign Governmental Entity, by attaching or executing process against the property of such Governmental Entity, the waiver by any Governmental Entity   as provided in Subparagraphs 14.1 and 14.2   is hereby expressly acknowledged by each such Governmental Entity to constitute a case  in which "the foreign state has waived its immunity from attachment in aid of execution or from execution," in accordance with 28 U.S.C.  1610(a)(1) of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (as amended).   Each such Governmental Entity also specifically agrees and concedes that the "commercial activity" exceptions to the FSIA, 28 U.S.C.  1610(a)(2), (d) are also applicable.  With respect to an action brought against the United States or any United States Governmental Entity, in the courts of any country, the U.S. Governmental Entity shall be understood to have voluntarily agreed to a corresponding waiver of immunity from actions in the courts of any other sovereign. 
        <p>
          14.2.4	With respect to any action or effort brought by an authorized end-user (as a third-party beneficiary, in accordance with Subparagraphs 14.3 and 14.10) in the United States to execute a judgment against a foreign Governmental Entity, by attaching or executing process against the property of such Governmental Entity, the waiver by any Governmental Entity   as provided in Subparagraphs 14.1 and 14.2   is hereby expressly acknowledged by each such Governmental Entity to constitute a case  in which "the foreign state has waived its immunity from attachment in aid of execution or from execution," in accordance with 28 U.S.C.  1610(a)(1) of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (as amended).  Each such Governmental Entity also specifically agrees and concedes that the "commercial activity" exceptions to the FSIA, 28 U.S.C.  1610(a)(2), (d) are also applicable.  With respect to an action brought against the United States or any United States Governmental Entity, in the courts of any country, the U.S. Governmental Entity shall be understood to have voluntarily agreed to a corresponding waiver of immunity from actions in the courts of any other sovereign.
         <p>
        14.3	Any Governmental Entity that uses, copies, changes, modifies, displays, performs, or distributes the Software or any part thereof, or any Governmental Person who does so (whether that person's Governmental Entity contends the person's action was, or was not, authorized or official), and thereby violates any terms and conditions of Section 9 (restrictions on modification), or Paragraph 10 (use restrictions), agrees that the person or entity is subject not only to an action by the Author, for the enforcement of this License Agreement and for money damages and injunctive relief (as well as attorneys' fees, additional and statutory damages, and other remedies as provided by law), but such Governmental Entity and/or Person also shall be subject to a suit for money damages and injunctive relief by any person whose human rights have been violated or infringed, in violation of this License Agreement, or through the use of any Software in violation of this License Agreement.  Any person who brings an action under this section against any Governmental Person or Entity must notify the Author promptly of the action and provide the Author the opportunity to intervene to assert the Author's own rights.   Damages in such a third-party action shall be measured by the severity of the human rights violation and the copyright infringement or License Agreement violation, combined, and not merely by reference to the copyright infringement.  All end-users, to the extent that they are entitled to bring suit against such Governmental Entity by way of this License Agreement, are intended third-party beneficiaries of this License Agreement.  Punitive damages may be awarded in such a third-party action against a Governmental Entity or Governmental Person, and each and every such Governmental Entity or Person conclusively waives all restrictions on the amount of punitive damages, and all defenses to the award of punitive damages   to the extend such limitations or defenses depend upon or are a function of such person or entity's status as a Governmental Person or Governmental Entity.
        <p>
          14.4	Any State of the United States, or any subunit or Governmental Entity thereof, that uses, copies, changes, modifies, displays, performs, or distributes the Software of any part thereof, or any of whose Governmental Persons does so (whether that person's Governmental Entity contends the person's action was, or was not, authorized or official), unconditionally and irrevocably waives   for purposes of any legal action (i) to enforce this License Agreement, (ii) to remedy infringement of the Author's copyright, or (iii) to invoke any of the third-party beneficiary rights set forth in Section 14.3 -- any immunity under the Eleventh Amendment of the United States Constitution or any other immunity doctrine (such as sovereign immunity or qualified, or other, official immunity) that may apply to state governments, subunits, or to their Governmental Persons. 
        <p>
        14.5	Any Governmental Entity (including, without limitation, any State of the United States), that uses, copies, changes, modifies, performs, displays, or distributes the Software or any part thereof, or any of whose Governmental Persons does so (whether that person's Governmental Entity contends the person's action was, or was not, authorized or official), unconditionally and irrevocably waives   for purposes of any legal action (i) to enforce this License Agreement, (ii) to remedy infringement of the Author's copyright, or (iii) to invoke any of the third-party beneficiary rights set forth in Section 14.3   any doctrine (such as, but not limited to, the holding in the United States Supreme Court decision of Ex Parte Young) that might purport to limit remedies solely to prospective injunctive relief.  Also explicitly and irrevocably waived is any underlying immunity doctrine that would require the recognition of such a limited exception for purposes of remedies.  The remedies against such governmental entities and persons shall explicitly include money damages, additional damages, statutory damages, consequential damages, exemplary damages, punitive damages, costs and fees that might otherwise be barred or limited in amount on account of governmental status.
        <p>
        14.6	Any Governmental Entity that uses, copies, changes, modifies, displays, performs, or distributes the Software or any part thereof, or any of whose Governmental Persons does so (whether that person's Governmental Entity contends the person's action was, or was not, authorized or official), unconditionally and irrevocably waives   for purposes of any legal action (i) to enforce this License Agreement, (ii) to remedy infringement of the Author's copyright, or (iii) to invoke any of the third-party beneficiary rights set forth in Section 14.3   any and all reliance on the Act of State doctrine, sovereign immunity, international comity, or any other doctrine of immunity   whether such doctrine is recognized in that government's own courts, or in the courts of any other government or nation.
        <p>
          14.6.1	Consistent with Subparagraphs 14.2.1 through 14.2.4, this waiver shall explicitly be understood to constitute a waiver not only against suit, but also against execution against property, for purposes of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (as amended).  All United States Governmental Entities shall be understood to have agreed to a corresponding waiver of immunity against (i) suit in the courts of other sovereigns, and (ii) execution against property of the United States located within the territory of other countries. 
        <p>
        14.7	Governmental Persons, (i) who violate this License Agreement (whether that person's Governmental Entity contends the person's action was, or was not, authorized or official), or (ii) who are personally involved in any activity, policy or practice of a governmental entity that violates this License Agreement (whether that person's Governmental Entity contends the person's action was, or was not, authorized or official), or (iii) that use, copy, change, modify, perform, display or distribute, the Software or any part thereof, when their Governmental Entity is not permitted to do so, or is not a Qualified Licensee, or has violated the terms of this License Agreement, each and all individually waive and shall not be permitted to assert any defense of official immunity, "good faith" immunity, qualified immunity, absolute immunity, or other immunity based on his or her governmental status.
        <p>
        14.8	No Governmental Entity, nor any Governmental Person thereof may, by legislative, regulatory, or other action, exempt such Governmental Entity, subunit, or person, from the terms of this License Agreement, if the Governmental Entity or any such person has voluntarily used, modified, copied, displayed, performed, or distributed the Software or any part thereof. 
        <p>
        14.9	Enforcement In Courts of Other Sovereigns Permitted.  By using, modifying, changing, displaying, performing or distributing any Software covered by this License Agreement, any Governmental Entity hereby voluntarily and irrevocably consents, for purposes of (i) any action to enforce the terms of this License Agreement, and (ii) any action to enforce the Author's copyright (whether such suit be for injunctive relief, damages, or both) to the jurisdiction of any court or tribunal in any other country (or a court of competent jurisdiction of a subunit, province, or state of such country) in which the terms of this License Agreement are believed by the Author to be enforceable.  Each such Governmental Entity hereby waives all objections to personal jurisdiction, all objections based on international comity, all objections based on the doctrine of forum non conveniens, and all objections based on sovereign or governmental status or immunity that might otherwise be asserted in the courts of some other sovereign.
        <p>
          14.9.1	The Waiver by any Governmental Entity of a country other than the United States shall be understood explicitly to constitute a waiver for purposes of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (see Subparagraphs 14.2.1to 14.2.4, inclusive, supra), and all United States Governmental Entities shall be understood to have agreed to a waive correspondingly broad in scope with respect to actions brought in the courts of other sovereigns.
        <p>
          14.9.2	Forum Selection   Non-U.S. Governmental Entities.  Governmental Entities that are not United States Governmental Entities shall be subject to suit, and agree to be subject to suit, in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.  The Author or an authorized end-user may bring an action in another court in another country, but the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, shall always be available as an agreed-upon forum for such an action.  At the optional election of any Author (or, in the case of a third-party claim, any end-user asserting rights under Subparagraphs 14.3 and 14.10), such a suit against a non-U.S. Governmental Entity or Person may be brought in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, or the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, as a direct substitute for the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, for all purposes of this Subparagraph.
        <p>
          14.9.3	Forum Selection   U.S. Governmental Entities.  All United States Governmental Entities shall be subject to suit, and agree to be subject to suit, in the following (non-exclusive) list of fora: Ottawa, Canada, London, England, and Paris, France.  The Author or an authorized end-user may bring action in another court that can exercise jurisdiction.  But the courts in these three locations shall always be available (at the option of the Author or an authorized end-user) as a forum for resolving any dispute with the United States or a governmental subunit thereof.  Except as provided in Subparagraph 14.10, any and all United States Governmental Persons shall be subject to suit wherever applicable rules of personal jurisdiction and venue shall permit such suit to be filed, but no such United States Governmental Person may assert any defense based on forum non conveniens or international comity, to the selection of any particular lawful venue.
        <p>
        14.10	Enforcement Of Claims For Human Rights Violations.  By using, copying, modifying, changing, performing, displaying or distributing the Software covered by this License Agreement, any Governmental Entity, or Governmental Person hereby voluntarily and irrevocably consents -- for purposes of any third-party action to remedy human rights violations and other violations of this License Agreement (as reflected in Section 14.3) -- to the jurisdiction of any court or tribunal in any other country (or a court of competent jurisdiction of a subunit, province, or state of such country) in which the third-party beneficiary reasonably believes the relevant terms of this License Agreement are enforceable.  The Governmental Entity or Person hereby waives all objections to personal jurisdiction, all objections based on international comity, all objections based on the doctrine of forum non conveniens, and all objections based on sovereign or governmental status or immunity that might otherwise be asserted in the courts of some other sovereign.
        <p>
          14.10.1	Waiver of Immunity and Forum Selection.  The presumptively valid and preferred fora identified in Subparagraphs 14.9.2 and 14.9.3 shall also apply for purposes of Subparagraph 14.10.  All Governmental Entities are subject to the same Waiver of Immunity as set forth in Subparagraphs 14.2.1 to 14.2.4, inclusive.
        <p>
        15. 	Subsequent Versions of HESSLA.  Hacktivismo may publish revised and/or new versions of the Hacktivismo Enhanced-Source Software License Agreement from time to time.  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. 
        <p>
        Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  Any Program released by Hacktivismo under a version of this License Agreement prior to Version 1.0, shall be considered released under Version 1.0 of the Hacktivismo Enhanced-Source Software License Agreement, once Version 1.0 is formally released.  Prior to Version 1.0, any Software released by Hacktivismo or a Licensee of Hacktivismo under a lower-numbered version of the HESSLA shall be considered automatically to be subject to a higher-number version of the HESSLA, whenever a later-numbered version has been released.
        <p>
        Concerning the work of any other Author, if the Program specifies a version number of this License Agreement which applies to it and "any later version," You have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by Hacktivismo.  If the Program does not specify a version number of this License Agreement, You may choose any version after 1.0, once version 1.0 is published by Hacktivismo, and prior to publication of version 1.0, You may choose any version of the Hacktivismo Software License Agreement then published by Hacktivismo.   If the Program released by another Author, specifies only a version number, then that version number only shall apply.  If "the latest version," is specified, then the latest version of the HESSLA published on the Hacktivismo Website shall always apply at all times.
        <p>
        16.  DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.  THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE WARRANTY OF NON-INFRINGEMENT AND WARRANTIES THAT THE ORIGINAL WORK IS MERCHANTABLE OR FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED WITH ALL FAULTS.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO LICENSE TO ORIGINAL WORK IS GRANTED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER. 
        <p>
        17.	 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.  UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING THE AUTHOR'S NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE AUTHOR BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER ARISING AS A RESULT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE SOFTWARE INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PERSON SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION, BUT SHALL EXCLUDE SUCH LIABILITY TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.  SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
        <p>
        18.	ENCRYPTION KEYS AND PUBLIC KEY INFRASTRUCTURE.  SOFTWARE RELEASED UNDER THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT MAY REQUIRE A DIGITAL CERTIFICATE, OR AN ENCRYPTION KEY "SIGNED" BY A TRUSTED PARTY, TO FUNCTION.  AUTHOR UNDERTAKES NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE PROPER, SECURE, AND ADEQUATE FUNCTIONING OF ANY CRYPTOGRAPHIC SYSTEMS, OF ANY CRYPTOGRAPHIC KEYS, OR FOR THE TRUSTWORTHINESS OF ANY END-USER, ANY ISSUER OF CERTIFICATES, OR OF ANY SIGNER OF ENCRYPTION KEYS.  USE OF THIS SOFTWARE IS AT THE END-USER'S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE RISK.  IN ANY PUBLIC-KEY INFRASTRUCTURE ("PKI") SYSTEM, AN END-USER'S LEGAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THE END-USER'S CERTIFICATION AUTHORITY DOES NOT INCLUDE OR ENCOMPASS ANY LEGAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THE AUTHOR, AND IS GOVERNED SOLELY AND EXCLUSIVELY BY THE CERTIFICATION AUTHORITY'S CERTIFICATION PRACTICE STATEMENT AND CERTIFICATION AGREEMENTS.  AUTHOR ASSUMES NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ACTIONS OR OMISSIONS OF ANY END-USER OR ANY CERTIFICATION AUTHORITY.
        <p>
        18.	Saving Clause.  If any portion of this License Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the License Agreement is intended to apply and the License Agreement as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

        <p><strong>Preamble</strong></p>
        <p>Most software today is developed with little to no thought of how it will be used, or the consequences for our society and planet.</p>
        <p>As software developers, we engineer the infrastructure of the 21st century. We recognise that our infrastructure has great power to shape the world and the lives of those we share it with, and we choose to consciously take responsibility for the social and environmental impacts of what we build.</p>
        <p>We envisage a world free from injustice, inequality, and the reckless destruction of lives and our planet. We reject slavery in all its forms, whether by force, indebtedness, or by algorithms that hack human vulnerabilities. We seek a world where humankind is at peace with our neighbours, nature, and ourselves. We want our work to enrich the physical, mental and spiritual wellbeing of all society.</p>
        <p>We build software to further this vision of a just world, or at the very least, to not put that vision further from reach.</p>

<pre>                         Aladdin Free Public Licence
                         (Version 7, June 4, 1998)

          Copyright (C) 1994, 1995, 1997, 1998 Aladdin Enterprises,
            Menlo Park, California, U.S.A. All rights reserved.

     NOTE: This Licence is not the same as any of the GNU Licences
     published by the Free Software Foundation. Its terms are
     substantially different from those of the GNU Licences. If you are
     familiar with the GNU Licences, please read this licence with
     extra care.

Aladdin Enterprises hereby grants to anyone the permission to apply this
Licence to their own work, as long as the entire Licence (including the
above notices and this paragraph) is copied with no changes, additions, or
deletions except for changing the first paragraph of Section 0 to include a
suitable description of the work to which the licence is being applied and
of the person or entity that holds the copyright in the work, and, if the
Licence is being applied to a work created in a country other than the
United States, replacing the first paragraph of Section 6 with an
appropriate reference to the laws of the appropriate country.

0. Subject Matter

This Licence applies to the computer program known as "GSview."  
The "Program", below, refers to such program.  The Program is a copyrighted
work whose copyright is held by Ghostgum Software Pty Ltd (the "Licensor").

A "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative
work of the Program, as defined in the United States Copyright Act of 1976,
such as a translation or a modification.

BY MODIFYING OR DISTRIBUTING THE PROGRAM (OR ANY WORK BASED ON THE PROGRAM),
YOU INDICATE YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THIS LICENSE TO DO SO, AND ALL ITS TERMS AND
CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTING OR MODIFYING THE PROGRAM OR WORKS BASED
ON IT. NOTHING OTHER THAN THIS LICENSE GRANTS YOU PERMISSION TO MODIFY OR
DISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM OR ITS DERIVATIVE WORKS. THESE ACTIONS ARE PROHIBITED
BY LAW. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, DO NOT MODIFY OR
DISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM.

1. Licences.

Licensor hereby grants you the following rights, provided that you comply
with all of the restrictions set forth in this Licence and provided,
further, that you distribute an unmodified copy of this Licence with the
Program:

(a)  You may copy and distribute literal (i.e., verbatim) copies of the
     Program's source code as you receive it throughout the world, in any
     medium.
(b)  You may modify the Program, create works based on the Program and
     distribute copies of such throughout the world, in any medium.

2. Restrictions.

This licence is subject to the following restrictions:

(a)  Distribution of the Program or any work based on the Program by a
     commercial organization to any third party is prohibited if any payment
     is made in connection with such distribution, whether directly (as in
     payment for a copy of the Program) or indirectly (as in payment for
     some service related to the Program, or payment for some product or
     service that includes a copy of the Program "without charge"; these are
     only examples, and not an exhaustive enumeration of prohibited
     activities). The following methods of distribution involving payment
     shall not in and of themselves be a violation of this restriction:
     (i)  Posting the Program on a public access information storage and
          retrieval service for which a fee is received for retrieving
          information (such as an on-line service), provided that the fee is
          not content-dependent (i.e., the fee would be the same for
          retrieving the same volume of information consisting of random
          data) and that access to the service and to the Program is
          available independent of any other product or service. An example
          of a service that does not fall under this section is an on-line
          service that is operated by a company and that is only available
          to customers of that company. (This is not an exhaustive
          enumeration.)
     (ii) Distributing the Program on removable computer-readable media,
          provided that the files containing the Program are reproduced
          entirely and verbatim on such media, that all information on such
          media be redistributable for non-commercial purposes without
          charge, and that such media are distributed by themselves (except
          for accompanying documentation) independent of any other product
          or service. Examples of such media include CD-ROM, magnetic tape,
          and optical storage media. (This is not intended to be an
          exhaustive list.) An example of a distribution that does not fall
          under this section is a CD-ROM included in a book or magazine.
          (This is not an exhaustive enumeration.)
(b)  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification of the
     Program are not subject to this Licence and they are outside its scope.
     Functional use (running) of the Program is not restricted, and any
     output produced through the use of the Program is subject to this
     licence only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
     (independent of having been made by running the Program).
(c)  You must meet all of the following conditions with respect to any work
     that you distribute or publish that in whole or in part contains or is
     derived from the Program or any part thereof ("the Work"):
     (i)  If you have modified the Program, you must cause the Work to carry
          prominent notices stating that you have modified the Program's
          files and the date of any change;
     (ii) You must cause the Work to be licensed as a whole and at no charge
          to all third parties under the terms of this Licence;
     (iii)
          If the Work normally reads commands interactively when run, you
          must cause it, at each time the Work commences operation, to print
          or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright
          notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying
          that you provide a warranty). Such notice must also state that
          users may redistribute the Work only under the conditions of this
          Licence and tell the user how to view the copy of this Licence
          included with the Work. (Exceptions: if the Program is interactive
          but normally prints or displays such an announcement only at the
          request of a user, such as in an "About box", the Work is required
          to print or display the notice only under the same circumstances;
          if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print
          such an announcement, the Work is not required to print an
          announcement.);
     (iv) You must accompany the Work with the complete corresponding
          machine-readable source code, delivered on a medium customarily
          used for software interchange. The source code for a work means
          the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For
          an executable work, complete source code means all the source code
          for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
          definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and
          installation of the executable code. If you distribute with the
          Work any component that is normally distributed (in either source
          or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and
          so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, you
          must also distribute the source code of that component if you have
          it and are allowed to do so;
     (v)  If you distribute any written or printed material at all with the
          Work, such material must include either a written copy of this
          Licence, or a prominent written indication that the Work is
          covered by this Licence and written instructions for printing
          and/or displaying the copy of the Licence on the distribution
          medium;
     (vi) You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipient's
          exercise of the rights granted herein.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering the
equivalent ability to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
ability to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution
of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the
source code along with the object code.

3. Reservation of Rights.

No rights are granted to the Program except as expressly set forth herein.
You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as
expressly provided under this Licence. Any attempt otherwise to copy,
modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically
terminate your rights under this Licence. However, parties who have received
copies, or rights, from you under this Licence will not have their licences
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

4. Other Restrictions.

If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain
countries for any reason, Licensor may add an explicit geographical
distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is
permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this
Licence incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this
Licence.

5. Limitations.

THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED TO YOU "AS IS," WITHOUT WARRANTY. THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS. THE ENTIRE
RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD
THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL
LICENSOR, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM
AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL,
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR
DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES
OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

6. General.

This Licence is governed by the laws of the State of Victoria, 
Australia, excluding choice of law rules.

If any part of this Licence is found to be in conflict with the law, that
part shall be interpreted in its broadest meaning consistent with the law,
and no other parts of the Licence shall be affected.</pre>
